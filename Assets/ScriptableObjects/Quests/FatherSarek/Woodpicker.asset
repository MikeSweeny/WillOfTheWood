  StartQuestText: '"Gooday friend, if you are keen on earning some gold, I have another
    task for you," the priest says, once more thumbing his holy sigil. "The Cathedral
    is the strongest place in Thorngard to resist the long-eared vermin of the woods,
    yet, I think it might be strengthened. The doors would be well served by a palisade
    and braces. I sent Gongomo, a timber-jack, to cut us some wood from the forest."
    The priest sighs deeply, "However, Gongomo was attacked by the elves and his cart
    was overtuned. His lumber is all about the outskirts of Thorngard, would you collect
    it?"'
  TrackingQuestText: Collect wood from Outskirts
  InprogressQuestText: '"The Cathedral needs that lumber, bring it to us as quickly
