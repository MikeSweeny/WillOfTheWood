  StartQuestText: Sarek turns to face you, his knuckles white as his hands grasp his
    robes, "They have come again, they are here still! Those foul elves, eight have
    come from their woods and taken another of my faithful." The priest releases his
    grip on his robes and attempts to steady himself, shaking like a man bearing a
    heavy load. "Deldas and his entire family were... were... it was not enough for
    them to take their lives but they are now dancing in the glee of their carnage
    upon his lands. Please... rid Deldas' home of those monsters. Take back his home
    at the far end of town."

  CompletedQuestText: Sarek releases a long-held breath and falls silent for a few
    moments. "This is well. Once again, Thorngard owes you a debt, I fear we will
    owe you a great many more before this calamity is done."
